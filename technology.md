# Technologies Used

## Data Transformation and Cleaning
To preform the analysis on the bitcoin.csv file, we begin by transforming and cleaning our data with pandas in Jupyter Notebook.


## Data Storge
After preforming the tranformation, we store our data in Postgresql.


### Machine Learning Models
We have created 4 different machine learning models to run our data through to determine which model provides the highest accuracy score and lowest loss.


### Dashboard
We are using Tableau to visualize our findings.

### At a Glance
Build a machine learning model to be able to accurately forecast future price of Bitcoin similar to that of the traditional stock market prediction.

### Data to Use and Question to Answer
Using historical bitcoin price data from ![Kaggle Bitcoin Historical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smartsunny/starter-bitcoin-historical-data-1d758000-5/data) . Can we use the daily weighted average price and volume of trades to predict what the future of Bitcoin prices will be.

### Data exploration 
* Transformed and cleaned data with Pandas in Jupyter Notebook 
* Dropping null values 
* Set timestamp as our index

### Data analysis

* Bitcoin exchanges running from January 2016 through August 2019
* Columns in dataset include
  * Date
  * Open Price
  * Close Price
  * High Price
  * Low Price
  * Volume (BTC)
  * Volume (Currency)
  * Weighted Price

### Technologies, Languages, and Tools

* Postgresql
* Jupyter Notebook
